# LinearRegression

The purpose of the `LinearRegression` package is to provide a simple implementation of linear regression. This package not only fits a linear regression model but also generates detailed statistics and visualizations to aid in model interpretation.

## Installation

You can install the development version of LinearRegression like so:

``` r
# Install from GitHub 
devtools::install_github("Kaixiang613/LinearRegression")
```

## Features

The `LinearRegression` package provides the following features:

1.  **Linear Regression (`linear_model_custom`)**:
    -   Fits a linear regression model.
    -   Calculates:
        -   Coefficients
        -   R-squared and Adjusted R-squared
        -   Standard errors
        -   t-values and p-values
    -   Outputs all key statistics in a single object for easy access.
2.  **Residual Analysis (`plot_residuals`)**:
    -   Visualizes the residuals of the model against fitted values.
    -   Helps in diagnosing model fit and identifying patterns in residuals.
3.  **Fitted Line Visualization (`plot_fitted_line`)**:
    -   Displays the fitted line for simple linear regression models.
    -   Useful for checking the linearity of relationships between predictors and responses. \## Usage

#### Fitting a Linear Regression Model

``` r
# Load the package
library(LinearRegression)

# Example data
X <- matrix(c(1, 2, 3, 4), ncol = 1)
y <- c(2.3, 4.1, 5.9, 8.2)

# Fit the model
model <- linear_model_custom(X, y)

# Display model results
print(model)
```

#### Visualizing Residuals

```

#### Plotting the Fitted Line

``` r
# Plot fitted line
plot_fitted_line(X, y, model$fitted_values)
```

``` r

```

## Data Requirements

-   The package assumes that:
    -   Predictors (`X`) are in a numeric matrix or data frame.
    -   Responses (`y`) are in a numeric vector.
    -   For visualization functions, only one predictor is supported for plotting fitted lines.
-   This package is ideal for:
    -   Simple exploratory data analysis.
    -   Teaching purposes to explain the basics of linear regression.
    -   Small-scale regression problems without the overhead of more complex frameworks like `lm()` or `glm()`.

## Error Handling

### Common Errors and Solutions

1.  **Error: "This function only supports one predictor for visualization."**
    -   This occurs when using `plot_fitted_line` with multiple predictors.
    -   Solution: Ensure your predictor matrix `X` contains only one column.
2.  **Error: "Singular matrix"**
    -   This occurs if the predictors in `X` are perfectly collinear.
    -   Solution: Check for multicollinearity in your data and remove redundant predictors.
3.  **Error: "Matrix dimensions do not match"**
    -   This occurs if the number of rows in `X` and `y` are not the same.
    -   Solution: Ensure that `X` and `y` have the same number of rows.

## Handling Outliers

``` r
# Identify outliers in residuals
model <- linear_model_custom(X, y)
residuals <- model$residuals
outliers <- which(abs(residuals) > 2 * sd(residuals))
print(outliers)
```
